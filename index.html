    <h1>Hi!</h1>

    <P>
        James Stephen "Jimmy" Donaldson (born May 7, 1998), more commonly known as MrBeast, is an American YouTuber. 
        He is known for his fast-paced and high-production videos, which feature elaborate challenges and large giveaways.
        With over 210 million subscribers, he is the most-subscribed individual on the platform and the second-most-subscribed channel overall.
        <br>
        <br>
        Donaldson grew up in Greenville, North Carolina. 
        He began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012, at the age of 13, under the handle MrBeast6000.
        His early content ranged from Let's Plays to "videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers". 
        He went viral in 2017 after his "counting to 100,000" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, 
        and he has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his videos gaining tens of millions of views.
        His videos became increasingly grand and extravagant. Once his channel took off, 
        Donaldson hired some of his childhood friends to co-run the brand. As of 2023, 
        the MrBeast team is made up of over 250 people, including Donaldson himself. Other than MrBeast, 
        Donaldson runs the YouTube channels Beast Reacts, MrBeast Gaming, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts)
        and the philanthropy channel Beast Philanthropy. He formerly ran MrBeast 3 (initially MrBeast 2), which is now inactive.
